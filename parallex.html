            Mountaineering, or mountain climbing, is the sport of reaching, or trying to reach, high points in mountainous areas, mainly for the joy and thrill of the climb. The sport involves intense physical activity. It includes hiking, rock climbing, and traversing slopes covered with ice and snow. Mountain climbing is by its nature risky; it can be quite dangerous unless climbers are properly trained. Climbers test their skills, strength, balance, resourcefulness, courage, and endurance as they master hazardous conditions and difficult terrain. Many also gain satisfaction from experiencing the grandeur of nature. The urge to “conquer” high peaks has led mountain climbers to develop the skills and tools that made it possible on May 29, 1953, for the New Zealand mountaineer Edmund Hillary and the Tibetan porter Tenzing Norgay to reach the world’s highest point, the summit of Mount Everest, 29,032 feet (8,849 meters) above sea level.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Paragliding demands jumping from high heels and to ski in the air for long hours. Therefore, a hill station having a stiff peak and a wide area for surfing in the air will be a suitable environment. If it will be played in any normal crowded area, then it is obvious that the user will face difficulty while paragliding.
            The area must also be free from any airline path so that the player should not face any emergency landing system due to an airplane approach. Adequate safety and protection must be taken care of before flying so that player can fly comfortably for long hours.

            <h2 class="desc">Surfing</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            In the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward the shore.
            There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing waves.
            The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard.
            Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave.
            Many surf historians and enthusiasts believe that the essence of surfing is in bodysurfing, the art of gliding over the waves using only the body as a planing surface.
            According to the University of Hawaii, bodysurfing dates back as far back as 2,000 BC, but the first evidence of bodysurfing activity in the Western world only emerged in 1899, when Australian Fred Williams got a few lessons from Polynesian islander Tommy Tana.
            The origins of the pastime can be traced back to the ancient Polynesian culture, specifically in the islands of Hawaii, where it was called "Heenalu" by the natives.
